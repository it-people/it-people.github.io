# Ruby, Rails and front-end beginners Community Site

 A couple students have created quality content around the subjects we discuss, and many of these materials are so good we feel that they should be shared with all of our students. This site is meant to serve as a central directory for community created content.

## Contributing

If you've created a web page, video, slideshow, or any other kind of media you think should be shared through this directory you should:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add a link to your content on the appropriate course page.
3. Commit your changes. 
4. Submit a pull request.

**Otherwise if you *are* the author of the content you're submitting** you should ask yourself the following questions:

1. Does my contribution teach?
2. Does the content of my contribution clearly address topics in the Ruby, Rails and front-end Specialization?
3. Could my contribution be seamlessly integrated into the canonical course materials?

If you're on the fence about any of these, err on the side of sending a pull request!
